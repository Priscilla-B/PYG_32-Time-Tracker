# PYG_32-Time-Tracker


File: time_tracker.py
--------------------
This program tracks the time a user takes to finish a project and returns the amount the user has earned on the project
based on the hours spent on the project and the dollars earned per hour spent. The user has to input the project name,
and a start and stop prompt for the timer to start and stop. After timer stops, the hours spent on the project are 
calculated and multiplied by the dollars earned per hour to determined the amount earned on the project.
The program inputs and outputs are initially saved in a dictionary and finally saved to a csv file.


File: time_tracker_data.csv
